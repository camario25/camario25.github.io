- Replace your lorem ipsum with actual content
- Remove commented out code from production versions of your site. (html & js)
- If you put your js file in a document.ready callback you can link your files to the top of your html docuement in your `<HEAD>`. This makes for easier comprehension of your site to other developers.
- Consider adding a function that would manipulate all of your `#favX` selectors. It would take a bit of extra work, but a function taht takes an id as an argument, an image url, etc. would be really slick and cut your line count down.
- Your CSS looks fantastic!  Consider organizing them by Tag, Class, then ID for easier reading of specificity.
- Add some responsive media-queries!
