          <h3>TESTIMONIALS</h3>
          <p>
            <i class="fas fa-quote-left" style="font-size:36px"></i>Mario is a consummate scholar. He dives in
            headfirst and dedicates himself fully to studying all the topics which interest him. These include:
            electronic music production, the French language, tea varietals and preparation around the world, data
            management and security, and web design. I am continually impressed by his tireless enthusiasm for learning.
            <i class="fas fa-quote-right right-i" style="font-size:36px"></i></br>--Senior Scientific Researcher,
            Genentech
          </p>
          <p>
            <i class="fas fa-quote-left" style="font-size:36px"></i>I had the pleasure of working with Mario for nearly
            two years after a team reorg landed us on a newly formed team. Mario is one of those rare teammates who
            combines technical reliability with deep thoughtfulness and a constant drive to grow. He cares deeply about
            quality of his work, and when he ships something, it’s solid, dependable, and well-considered.

            He’s also incredibly receptive to feedback and always looking to learn more. Whether it’s digging into a
            tricky problem, asking insightful questions, or incorporating suggestions from others, Mario brings a
            humility and curiosity that make collaboration easy and genuinely rewarding.

            On top of all that, he’s just a very kind person. He listens well, communicates clearly, and makes the team
            better by being part of it.
            <i class="fas fa-quote-right right-i" style="font-size:36px"></i></br>--Staff Software Engineer,
            LinkedIn
          </p>
          <p>
            <i class="fas fa-quote-left" style="font-size:36px"></i>Mario joined my team as a UI engineer, and
            successfully transitioned into a full-stack sr engineer role. During his tenure, he continuously worked to
            expand his technical skills, particularly as our team moved into building agentic workflows and AI-driven
            work. Mario was always receptive to feedback, open to self-development, and approaching challenges with an
            open mindset. His participation in the HOLA ERG also showed his effort to help others feel included at
            LinkedIn. Mario would be a collaborative and well-liked member of any team.

            LinkedIn
          </p>
          <p>
            <i class="fas fa-quote-left" style="font-size:36px"></i>Mario is a great pleasure to work with. He has
            strong technical skills, and he’s a quick study, but it’s his can-do attitude that really shines. Mario
            attacks his work with an eagerness to learn, and an optimism that makes working with him delightful.
            <i class="fas fa-quote-right right-i" style="font-size:36px"></i></br>--Senior Staff Engineer,
            LinkedIn
          </p>
          <p>
            <i class="fas fa-quote-left" style="font-size:36px"></i>What continues to stand out about Mario is his
            collaborative spirit, positivity, and his ability to support those around him. When I joined the team, Mario
            was especially supportive in helping me get up to speed with our tools and on-call responsibilities. His
            code reviews are always thoughtful and actionable, and he has a talent for articulating his ideas clearly,
            whether it's in one-on-one discussions or broader team forums. He’s great at driving alignment and ensuring
            everyone is on the same page.

            Mario is a fantastic teammate and engineer, and I’ve learned a lot from him over the years!

      <p id="aboutP">I’m a Senior Software Engineer with a unique background that blends creativity with technical
        expertise. My journey into tech began through the arts—while coordinating youth programs at MACLA in San Jose
        (2015–2017), I taught digital media literacy to underrepresented teens. Guiding them through creative tools for
        music and digital art sparked a deeper curiosity: How is this software built? That question led me to teach
        myself how to code.

        Determined to pursue this path, I completed the Web Development Immersive at General Assembly in San Francisco,
        which opened doors to opportunities at Adobe and later an engineering apprenticeship at LinkedIn. There, I grew
        from apprentice to Senior Software Engineer, gaining experience across SRE, frontend, and full-stack
        development.

        At my core, I’m both a creative and a problem solver. Software engineering allows me to merge those
        passions—building tools that connect people, tell stories, and make technology more human. I’m energized by the
        opportunity to contribute to teams where innovation, impact, and empathy truly matter.
