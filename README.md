On this solo project, I learned a great deal about making a website.

I created a wireframe and I put the elements that I knew I would need in order from top to bottom.  I made special notes where CSS flexbox would come in handy from making elements go from vertical to horizontal.

I use boostrap for the carousel and font awesome for the logos.

I also used an external font by downloading the otc files and then converting them to woff and woff2 files.

I created a random cloud generator to add some animation.  For future development, I plan to allow the user to change the speed and quantity of the clouds.
