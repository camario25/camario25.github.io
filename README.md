# Project Overview

This project was originally created as part of my web development bootcamp in 2018. It served as a solo exploration of building a website from the ground up. In 2025, I revisited and updated the project to reflect modern standards and to document my growth as a developer.

## Development Highlights

- Created wireframes to map out the site layout, organizing elements from top to bottom.
- Included notes for using **CSS Flexbox** to handle responsive layouts (e.g., shifting elements from vertical to horizontal).
- Implemented a **Bootstrap** carousel for image transitions.
- Used **Font Awesome** for iconography.
- Integrated an external font by converting `.otf` files to `.woff` and `.woff2` formats for web optimization.
- Developed a **random cloud generator** to add animated visual effects.

  > *Future enhancement idea: Allow users to adjust cloud speed and quantity.*

## 2025 Update

This update includes:

- Updated language
- Added the **Tic Na Cho** project
- Code cleanup
- Improved documentation

This project serves both as a reflection of my early learning and a showcase of how far Iâ€™ve come as a developer.
